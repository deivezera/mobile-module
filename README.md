# Overview

This project is a React Native app for scheduling events and managing notifications. It uses Expo for development and TypeScript for type safety. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete events, and schedule local notifications to remind them of upcoming events. It also uses AsyncStorage to persist data locally and Zustand for state management. The app is built with a clean and responsive design using NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native).

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code with the TypeScript compiler (tsc) configured through a tsconfig.json file.
I ran the application in a Node.js environment to execute TypeScript output in the terminal.

Tools and Libraries:

- TypeScript (typed superset of JavaScript)
- TSLint / ESLint for code linting
- Expo for development
- React Native for building the app
- AsyncStorage for local storage
- NativeWind for styling
- React Native Notifications for notifications
